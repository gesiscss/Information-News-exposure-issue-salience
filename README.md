# Information-News-exposure-issue-salience


In this thesis, we are interested in understanding how peopleâ€™s online news reading activity is related to what they believe to be the most important global issue to them.

To achieve that, we were provided with two datasets containing textual articles that a set of users viewed. We give details of the corpus-specific data wrangling techniques that were applied to delete any records that are not actual articles. We, then, describe the LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) training and our combined evaluation approach that were conducted to extract latent topics in the corpus. 

Lastly, we present a method that aggregates topics of the read articles to different users in the form of a matrix and then compares it with their preferred topics.
